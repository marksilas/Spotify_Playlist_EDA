# Spotify_Playlist_EDA
Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon created Spotify, a non-free Swedish audio streaming and media services provider, on April 23, 2006. As of March 2022, it had over 422 million monthly active users, including 182 million paid members, making it one of the top music streaming service providers.

This project demonstrates how to extract a Spotify playlist dataset and perform exploratory data analysis on the features. This project, in particular, extracts data from a playlist called "Hot Naija Hits" and investigates the features of the songs.
